# The Game

In lieu of Dungeons and Dragons, a growing group of us have been playing a rather crunchy RPG that I designed. So far, we've simply called this tabletop RPG "The Game" or, originally, "The Board Game," because we used to play it using those old cardboard tiles (along with figurines) on a tabletop.

Unfortunately, the crunchy probability and modifier mechanics of The Game have led to very, very long sessions calculating the outcomes of in-game actions. This is what led me to build a variety of apps to handle those calculations. This project is the Angular 5 (and eventually Java Spring) version of The Game.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
